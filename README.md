This project was initially created as part of the required projects for FreeCodeCamps APIs and MicroServices Certification.

It is a URL shortener, similar to bitly or tinyurl that will take a URL formatted with http:// or https:// and return a json object
that is an index. That index will forward to the originally submitted URL when it is added at the tail end of the project url.
URLs can be submitted via the form on the front-end of the site or directly to the /api/shorturl endpoint.

This project has been deployed via heroku and can be accessed via the below URL:
